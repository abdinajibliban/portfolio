# Unit 08 Homework: Professional Materials ReadMe

# portfolio by Abdinajib Liban

## Overview

```
My homework for this week was to use the skills I have gained 
at The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp to update my portfolio page 
and other materials. This is an important step towards being employer-competitive.
```

## Requirements

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Submit an updated resume

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile

# My Result

```
I built a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework. The index.html file contains my home page.
The home page features my full name, a professional image of me, and a brief description. It also features my
email and phone number. There are also three icons that upon being pressed lead to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and 
a downloadable Resume.

The navbar can be used to navigate to my contact page which contains a contact form. The Projects page features three of
my best work. I highlight my project one along with the schedular and code quiz homeworks. Each card contains a description
and a preview image. When one clicks on the preview image they are sent to the live git site.

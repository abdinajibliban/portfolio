# Unit 16 Project 2 Homework: Professional Materials

# portfolio by Abdinajib Liban

## Overview

```
My homework for this week was to use the skills I have gained 
at The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp to update my portfolio page 
and other materials. This is an important step towards being employer-competitive.
```

## Requirements

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks.

* Submit an updated resume.

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile.

# My Result

```
I built a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework. The index.html file contains my home page.
The home page features my full name, a professional image of me, and a brief description. It also features my
email and phone number. There are also three icons that upon being pressed lead to my updated LinkedIn, GitHub, and 
a downloadable Resume.

The navbar can be used to navigate to my contact page which contains a contact form. The Projects page features some of
my best work. I highlight my project one along with the schedular, code quiz, burger logger and note taker homeworks. 
Each card contains a description and a preview image. When one clicks on the preview image they are sent to the live git site or deployed heroku.

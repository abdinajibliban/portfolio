Portfolio by Abdinajib Liban

# My Task

This week I was instructed to use Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I was instructed to create three files: index.html , contact.html, and portfolio.html.

# Hints and Requirements

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


My Result

I was able to create a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootsrap CSS Framework. The index.html file contains my home page which includes a image and brief information about me and my email. The portfolio.html page contains photos of me and an explanation of projects I've worked on the past few weeks. And finally, the contact.html folder contained the likeness of a form which users can use to get in contact with me. All three of these pages optime both "xs" and "sm" screens.
